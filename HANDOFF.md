# HANDOFF — collab-claw v0.1.1

Status: **shipped + hardened**. v1 is live at
`github.com/sankalpgunturi/collab-claw`. All five test suites pass (70
cases). The marketplace install path is verified. The eight findings
from the v1 review are all resolved — see "Review fixes (v0.1.1)" below.

## What you can do right now

### As a host (with Claude Code)

```bash
# 1. Install the CLI globally (from your local checkout)
cd ~/Repositories/collab-claw
npm link

# 2. Install the plugin in Claude Code
claude
> /plugin marketplace add sankalpgunturi/collab-claw
> /plugin install collab-claw

# 3. Restart claude, set your name, host
collab-claw set-name Surya
claude
> /collab-claw:host
```

You'll get a join URL like `http://10.0.0.42:7474#secret=...`. DM it to
teammates and keep working with Claude as usual.

### As a joiner (no Claude Code needed)

```bash
cd ~/Repositories/collab-claw   # or wherever your teammate cloned
npm link                         # one-time
collab-claw set-name Sankalp     # one-time
collab-claw join <URL Surya DMd you>
```

Surya will see `[collab-claw] Sankalp wants to join...` and run
`/collab-claw:approve <id>`. Then your TUI lights up.

### Other commands (any time)

```bash
collab-claw status     # show current room state
collab-claw leave      # joiner leaves
collab-claw end        # host tears down the room
collab-claw kick Eve   # host removes a member
```

## Review fixes (v0.1.1)

Eight findings, all addressed:

1. **Joiner prompts no longer drop during monitor reconnect windows.**
   The relay queues prompts with monotonic seq numbers, and the host
   monitor uses standard SSE `Last-Event-ID` to resume from where it
   left off. Prompts that arrive while no monitor is connected are
   replayed as soon as one connects. (`#1` in `test/regressions.mjs`)

2. **Single host-monitor subscriber is enforced server-side.** A new
   `/prompt-stream` connect evicts any existing one (last-writer-wins),
   so a stale post-`/plugin reload` monitor can't double-deliver
   prompts to Claude. The monitor also keeps a PID-file lock at
   `~/.collab-claw/monitor.pid` as defense in depth. (`#2`)

3. **Kicked members' transcript SSE is closed by the relay.** The
   transcript-stream subscriber map now stores `(res, memberId)`, so
   `/kicks` and `/leaves` find and end exactly that member's open
   streams. The joiner TUI also detects 401 on reconnect and exits
   cleanly. (`#3`)

4. **Join-request names are validated server-side** with the same
   regex the CLI uses (1–32 chars, alphanumeric/space/_/-). System
   announcements emit `kind=system` with NO `name` field; the monitor
   renders them as `[collab-claw] <text>` (single brackets), matching
   what the host SKILL teaches Claude. The earlier
   `[[collab-claw]]: ...` regression is fixed. (`#4a`, `#4b`)

5. **Multiline joiner prompts arrive as one notification.** The
   monitor escapes `\n` to a literal `\n` sequence before writing to
   stdout, so Claude Code's monitor framework attributes the whole
   prompt to one named teammate. (`#5`)

6. **Plugin shims renamed to unique names** (`collab-claw-host`,
   `collab-claw-end`, etc.) so they don't collide with system
   binaries like `host` (DNS). SKILLs and `allowed-tools:
   Bash(collab-claw-X:*)` updated accordingly.

7. **Stop hook prefers `last_assistant_message` from the hook input**
   when present, falling back to JSONL transcript parsing only when
   needed.

8. **`prompt-submit` no longer depends on jq/sed.** The hook pipes
   stdin straight into `collab-claw post-prompt --from-hook`, which
   uses `JSON.parse` to extract the prompt. Robust on multiline and
   quote-escaped input.

## What's known to work (verified by tests)

- **Relay**: 12 user-facing routes plus `/healthz`, `/info`, and a
  test-only `/debug/requests`. Bearer auth (host token / member
  token / request-id / room secret), SSE keepalives, ring buffer for
  backfill, prompt queue with `Last-Event-ID` replay,
  single-subscriber `/prompt-stream`, proper 401/404/409 handling.
  (`test/smoke.mjs` 21 cases + `test/regressions.mjs` 23 cases)

- **Pairing handshake**: joiner POSTs `/join-requests` with the room
  secret → long-polls `/wait` → host approves via host token →
  joiner's `wait` resolves with their member token. Member tokens never
  pass through the host's plugin or Claude Code transcript.
  (`test/smoke.mjs`)

- **CLI host/join/approve/end loop**: full local round-trip including
  the Stop hook reading a fake transcript and posting the response.
  (`test/e2e-cli.mjs`, 18 cases)

- **Tool call mirroring**: `PreToolUse` and `PostToolUse` hooks render
  `▸ wants to run Bash: <cmd>` and `✓ Bash: <cmd>` lines that joiners
  see live. (`test/e2e-cli.mjs`)

- **Monitor session-state gate** (the critical Spike B/C finding):
  - **Negative control**: gate closed (no session.json) → prompts
    posted to relay are NOT delivered to monitor stdout.
  - **Positive control**: gate open → monitor opens SSE, emits
    `[Name]: <text>` lines that wake an idle Claude.
  - **Mid-stream close**: deleting session.json while events are in
    flight drops them before they reach stdout.
    (`test/monitor-gate.mjs`, 5 cases)

- **TUI plain mode**: when stdin/stdout aren't TTYs, the joiner CLI
  falls back to readline prompts and plain-text event rendering.
  (`test/tui-plain.mjs`, 3 cases)

- **Regression coverage** for the eight v0.1.1 review fixes — queue
  replay, singleton, kicked SSE close, name validation, system
  format, multiline encoding. (`test/regressions.mjs`, 23 cases)

- **Marketplace install path**: a fresh `git clone` of the published
  repo has the right layout, executable bits on all bin/ scripts, and
  `npm test` passes clean.

## What's known to be rough (deferred to v1.1)

- **Cross-network**: the relay binds 0.0.0.0 so it's reachable on the
  LAN, but if your teammates are on different networks you need to
  manually tunnel (Cloudflared, ngrok, etc). A `collab-claw expose`
  subcommand that wraps `cloudflared tunnel --url` is on the roadmap.

- **Persistence**: transcripts only live in the relay's in-memory ring
  buffer (last 200 events). Restarting the host loses everything.
  v1.1 will optionally write `~/.collab-claw/log/<roomId>.jsonl`.

- **Markdown rendering**: the TUI shows event text verbatim. Code
  blocks come through as raw triple-backticks. Want a tasteful subset
  (bold, inline-code highlight, code-block fencing) — not the full
  CommonMark.

- **Reconnection**: if the host's laptop sleeps or the relay dies, the
  joiner CLIs see the SSE close and silently retry. They don't notify
  the user clearly. v1.1 needs a "host went offline" state in the
  status bar.

- **Multi-room / multi-host**: each `collab-claw host` starts one
  relay listening on one port. If the host wants to run two parallel
  rooms, they'd need to manually set `COLLAB_CLAW_PORT`. Not designed
  for it; one room per machine is fine.

- **The TUI status bar**: shows member count and last round-trip
  latency, but not who's currently typing or who joined recently.
  Would be nice to have presence indicators.

- **No automated full-Claude integration test**. We've validated every
  layer except the actual `[Name]: <text>` → idle Claude wakeup, but
  Spike B already proved that path works (see `SPIKE_B_RESULTS.md`).
  When you wake up, give it a real spin: host with Claude, join from
  another terminal, send a prompt, confirm Claude wakes and responds.

## Critical files (in order of complexity)

1. `src/relay/server.mjs` — the 12-route relay. Most product logic
   lives here. ~480 lines.

2. `src/tui/join.mjs` — raw-ANSI joiner TUI with scroll region +
   anchored prompt. ~360 lines. The trickiest non-relay code.

3. `src/commands/monitor.mjs` — the always-on, session-gated SSE
   consumer that emits `[Name]: <text>` to stdout for Claude. ~150
   lines. Watch the gate logic carefully if you ever modify it; the
   negative-control test is your safety net.

4. `src/commands/post-stop.mjs` — parses the Claude Code transcript
   JSONL to extract the last assistant message. Robust against the
   three known transcript shapes (`message.content[]`,
   `content[]`, `content` string). If Claude Code changes its
   transcript format, this is the file to update.

5. `plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — the top-level `monitors`
   array. Spike B's central finding: if you ever set `when:
   on-skill-invoke:host`, the monitor silently never starts. Leave
   it as a top-level `monitors` array with no `when` field.

## How to verify everything works (5-min sanity check)

```bash
cd ~/Repositories/collab-claw
npm test                 # 70/70 should pass

# Manual sanity:
npm link                 # ensure global `collab-claw` is on PATH

# Terminal A (the would-be Claude session — we'll fake it with curl)
collab-claw set-name TestHost
node ./bin/collab-claw host
# Note the join URL printed.

# Terminal B (joiner)
collab-claw set-name TestJoiner
collab-claw join "http://...#secret=..."
# It says "Waiting for host approval".

# Terminal A (approve)
collab-claw status         # see the pending request id
# OR: tail the relay log via /healthz, then:
collab-claw approve <requestId>

# Terminal B should now show "Joined" and a TUI.
# Type a prompt and hit Enter. (No Claude is listening, so no response,
# but you can verify the prompt POST succeeded via curl /recent.)

# Terminal A:
collab-claw end
```

For the full Claude-in-loop test, install the plugin in Claude Code and
do `/collab-claw:host` — Spike C's manual runbook lives in
`spikes/spike-c/README.md` if you want a step-by-step.

## Where the code is

- Repo: https://github.com/sankalpgunturi/collab-claw
- Latest commit: `1f3eaba feat: v1 collab-claw — relay, CLI, joiner TUI, host plugin`
- All on `main`. No release tag yet — when you're satisfied, run:
  ```bash
  git tag v0.1.0 && git push --tags
  ```

## Roadmap suggestions (what I'd build next)

1. `collab-claw expose` — wrap `cloudflared tunnel --url
   http://localhost:7474` so cross-network works without telling users
   to install Cloudflared themselves.

2. `collab-claw recent --since=10m` — replay the last N minutes of a
   room into the joiner's TUI on join (currently we only replay the
   ring buffer, which has no time filter).

3. Persist transcripts to `~/.collab-claw/log/<roomId>.jsonl` and add
   a `collab-claw history` command.

4. NPM publish: `npm publish` (requires user's npm credentials).
   Until then, install is git-clone + npm-link.

5. Homebrew tap: `brew tap collab-claw/tap && brew install
   collab-claw`. Tap repo can be a sibling repo with a single
   `Formula/collab-claw.rb`.

6. Markdown rendering subset in TUI (bold, italic, inline code,
   fenced code blocks). Avoid heavy deps — write ~150 lines of regex.

## Last words

The architecture survived contact with reality. Spikes A, B, and C
caught the three things I would have built wrong: marketplace layout,
monitor activation trigger, and the session-state gate. The v1 build
went smoothly because of that — every test passed on the first or
second iteration.

Pour yourself a coffee in the morning, run through the 5-min sanity
check, and if `[Sankalp]: hello` wakes Claude up on your end, ship it
to your friends.
